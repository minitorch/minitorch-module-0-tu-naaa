In this task, I need to hand-create classifiers that split each linear dataset into the correct colors by using streamlit server.

Here are the discription of the parameters that I used.

#### 1
Dataset = Simple, Number of points = 50
  - linear.weight_0_0 = -2.13
  
  - linear.weight_1_0 = 0.15
  
  - Parameter: linear.bias_0 = 0.66
